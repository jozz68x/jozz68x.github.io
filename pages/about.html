            I should confess that I am kind of an introvert, so I use this overly used thing for (mostly)procrastination called as the "internet" to show-off my skills. I can't say that I'm a pro at what I do, but I can say that I am really OCD about delivering a good work that I myself and the people I worked for will be proud to look at, and in this process I am trying my best - well not to be a pro but a better version of myself.

            In other words I am kind of a pain in the two rounded portions of the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region of apes - as I nitpick a lot. Not because I am purposely annoying, but because I have a thing for my work being perfect. And yes, I took that really fancy definition of butts from Wikipedia (yes that's NSFW).

            I am Sudipto Mondal, a self taught Graphic/Motion Designer and a Front-End Designer/Developer. And I am avid about drawing, illustrating, moving and coding stuffs.
